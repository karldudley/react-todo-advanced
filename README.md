# 🎯 Advanced Todo App

**Live Demo:** [https://funkytodoapp.netlify.app/](https://funkytodoapp.netlify.app/)

Welcome to the most unnecessarily advanced todo app you never knew you needed! 🚀 Because why settle for boring checkboxes when you can have a full-featured task management experience that makes organizing your life feel like playing a video game?

This isn't your grandmother's todo list (though she'd probably love the dark mode toggle). We've packed more features into this bad boy than most enterprise applications, and we're oddly proud of that.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add, edit, and delete todos (the classics never go out of style)
- ⭐ Star your favorite tasks (because some todos are more special than others)
- 🌙 Dark/Light mode toggle (for those late-night productivity sessions)
- 🎨 Smooth animations and modern UI
- 📱 Responsive design that works everywhere

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is built with a carefully curated stack of modern web technologies:

- **React 18** - The UI library that makes everything possible
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool and dev server
- **CSS3** - Custom styling with modern features
- **ESLint** - Code quality and consistency
- **Netlify** - Deployment and hosting
